# Student Attendance System

Welcome to the Student Attendance System! This project allows you to manage students and classes, track attendance, and export attendance records to Excel files. This is my first major independent project, and while it has some issues and lacks full validation, the core functionalities are operational.

- **Student Management**: Create and manage student records.
- **Class Management**: Organize students into classes/groups.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Mark attendance for students on specific dates.
- **Export to Excel**: Generate Excel files with attendance data for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented in Vanilla Java, utilizing core Java features without external frameworks except Java Swing.
